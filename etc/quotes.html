<h2>Long quotes</h2>
<div>
	<blockquote>Your natural state is Enlightening. Everything else you've ever been told about yourself is a lie. We are trying to wake ourselves up, because we come from Source Energy and we are all one. We have to realize that our brothers and sisters that we're seeing in the Dream are mere reflections of our inner self. Yin and Yang, Love and Hate, people that we dislike are mere reflections of our own character defects, people that we like and love are true successful manifestations of our deepest most inner self. We are beings of Light. Our mission is to be Creation, and create positive energy on Spaceship Earth.</blockquote>
	<p>Hamsish "Illusion" Patterson, abridged for Anamanaguchi's <code>(T-T)b</code>, 2012</p>

<div>
	<blockquote>It may be true that the world has no need of borders, but would getting rid of them really change anything? The world won't change for the better unless we trust people, trust is vital in a peaceful world, but that will never happen... I'm still on the battlefield, right now I'm near a border. I want to see for myself what borders really mean, and what their volition really is. I may not find what I'm looking for but I still wanna try. Anyway that's what I've come to believe and I think that's enough.</blockquote>
	<p>Larry "Solo Wing Pixy" Foulke (character from Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War), Project Aces, 2006</p>
