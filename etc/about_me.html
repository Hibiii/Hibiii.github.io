<h1>About Me</h1>
<span>Oh no, it's this page again where I have to talk about myself but I don't like bragging about achievements, it's more about the person and the work I've done rather than "I'm great because this and that."</span>
<p>I'm not perfect, alright? I'm just some nerd that loves games, cars and trains.</p>

<p>I love modding Minecraft, even if my mods aren't popular. With it, I know a decent amount of Java, Sponge Mixins, and I love doing pixel art as well! Even if for a specific purpose.</p>
<p>During my time in uni, I was assigned projects in pure, raw C. Like yay, I guess? But damn, I'm not happy about it.</p>
<p>A long time ago, when I was a child, I used to play a lot on this train simulator called BVE, and then OpenBVE. I still know to this day how to make 3D models for it and how to make train lines for it. This is a certified CreateMeshBuilder moment.</p>
<p>More recently, I've done a couple of projects in JS and TS. These include ncCounter, a "counter" for Neocities that used the Neocities API to get the amount of views, and Kittencraft, <del>an evil abomination I was about to curse this fragile Earth with,</del> a project I decided to can due to, well, it being weird asf. The code is private, but damn it actually works.</p>
