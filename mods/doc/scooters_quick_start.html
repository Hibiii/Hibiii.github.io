<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Scooters Mod only requires Fabric API. Make sure you have the correct version for your Minecraft.</p>
<p>Scooters Mod is <b>required</b> in the server as well. Install it like you would install any other Fabric mod in a server.</p>

<h2>Tires</h2>

<p>You can't go anywhere without tires. They will take damage over time, but they can be repaired with each other efficiently or patched up manually.</p>
<p>To craft a tire, place wool (any color) and coal blocks alternating in a ring, with iron bars in the middle as the rim. The result will be an unprocessed tire that needs to be vulcanized.</p>
<p>You can only vulcanize tires on a blast furnace, as it needs to be in a very hot place for a long enough amount of time such that the surface is grippy and durable.</p>

<p>Repairing a tire can be done in three ways: using a grindstone, patching the tire, and the traditional combining two of the same. Grindstones are the most effective as it not only combines the durability of both tires, but also gives a 25% bonus, the best option if you only have old tires lying around. Patching a tire requires a piece of wool and a coal block, and you'll need to vulcanize it as well. It's most effective when the tire is completely dead. Combining two of the same is the same old recipe of take two together, combine their durability and add 5%.</p>
<p>Rumor has it your tires can be enchanted with unbreaking and mending, but our tire supplier has refused to talk about this, claiming it is nonsense!</p>

<h2>The Kick Scooter</h2>
<p>Kick Scooters are an easy way to get around but you need some infrastructure. They aren't the fastest but they're a nice, biome-independent alternative to horses.</p>
<p>To craft your scooter, you need to place iron items in a vaguely scooter-like shape.</p>
<p>Press the <abbr title="Forwards">W</abbr> key to accelerate, and the <abbr title="Backwards">S</abbr> key to brake. The <abbr title="Left">A</abbr> and <abbr title="Right">D</abbr> keys will steer in their directions. As usual, press the <abbr title="Sneak">Shift</abbr> key to dismount a scooter.</p>
<p>You may need to perform maintenance on your scooter. Right click the scooter while sneaking to open its screen. On it, you can see the status of the tires.</p>

<h2>The Electric Scooter</h2>
<p>Electric scooters are the big brothers of the kick scooters. They drive faster, harder and stronger, but are much more expensive.</p>
<p>To craft an electric scooter, you need a scooter, two pieces of netherite scrap, two redstone dust, a redstone torch, and a lever.</p>
<p>For the electric scooter to work, you need batteries. Scooters accept potatoes as batteries. You'll need to open the scooter's screen.</p>
<p>On the scooter's screen, you can not only see the tires, but also the batteries and their status. The top slot accepts "charged batteries", or normal potatoes. The bottom slot accepts "dead batteries" or poisonous potatoes. The arrow on the right represents how chaged the current potato is, and the spark flashes when the scooter is recharging. There cannot be more than 64 potatos at a time. Do not touch the batteries when they are powered.</p>

<p>Using up your battery, you'll end up with poisonous potatos, which can then be recharged back up again. To recharge a scooter, you need a charging station. Park your scooter next to one and right click the charger. To unplug, right click either the charger, or the scooter.</p>

<h2>The Charging Station</h2>
<p>Charging stations are a nice extra. They provide power to electric scooters and help reduce waste by giving putting energy back in the spent potatos.</p>
<p>They can be crafted with stone, redstone, gold, and quartz.</p>
<p>A charging station requires redstone power to be able to recharge a scooter.</p>
