<p>This is not an actual mod. This page only contains ideas for a future mod, which I haven't started work on.</p>
<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
<p>These ideas are 100% compatible with, well, all servers, and should not in theory give you an advantage.</p>
<h3>Particle Effects</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Water dripping from ice when and where it can melt</li>
	<li>Variable smoke from fires (less in hot places, more in cold places)</li>
	<li>Souls escaping soul sand at random</li>
	<li>Sparks coming from complete beacon pyramids</li>
	<li>Pollen from flowers</li>
	<li>Item despawning</li>
	<li>Players logging in and out</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sound Effects</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Water flowing noises from rivers and oceans (large bodies still water)</li>
	<li>Chain clanking from hung chains</li>
	<li>Water rustling under boats</li>
	<li>Amethyst randomly chiming</li>
	<li>Scaffolding creaking</li>
	<li>Clocks on item frames ticking like wall clocks</li>
	<li>Electrical noises from redstone components</li>
	<li>Metallic creaking from extended pistons</li>
	<li>Coil whine from active comparators, louder if in subtract mode</li>
	<li>Wind noise all the time</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gameplay Additions</h2>
<p>These ideas, while they may be 100% compatible with the other side of the client-server paradigm, is just, different. Any clientside mods aren't guaranteed to not trip anticheats, but are less likely.</p>
<h3>Clientside Effects</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Heat Stroke</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Caused by sun exposure, hot biomes, and merely existing in The Nether, as well as being on fire<sup>(1)</sup></li>
			<li>Symptoms are slowness, nausea, weakness and mining fatigue</li>
			<li>Treated by water bottles, fire resistance, and items that provide shade<sup>(2)</sup></li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>1</b>: Technically, heat stroke would only be inflicted upon being extinguished because adrenaline of being on fire and all. <b>2</b>: Items that provide shade are to be set with a resource pack. In one of my resource packs, the Totem of Undying is an umbrella uwu.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Cold</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Caused by swimming in cold biomes, being too high in the world, outdoors at night in cold biomes, as well as deep, dark, and narrow caves, and receiving rain without a shade</li>
			<li>Symptom is pretty much the freezing effect, but no actual hurting</li>
			<li>Treated by standing next to fire, next to insulation (wool) and wearing leather armor</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Serverside: additional random ticks</h3>
<ul>
	<h4>Aging of Building Materials</h4>
	<li>Mossy cobblestone or stone bricks turning into normal ones in sunlight or in heat</li>
	<li>Cobblestone and stone bricks turning into mossy when wet</li>
	<li>Bricks and tiles crack under pressure and heat</li>
	<h4>Nature Finds a Way</h4>
	<li>Moss carpet spreads in dark and humid conditions</li>
	<li>Moss turns into pozdol under sunlight</li>
	<li>Vines growing under leaves</li>
	<li>Azalea leaves bloom and wilt</li>
	<li>Leaves can spread</li>
	<li>Rarely, trees can create grass</li>
	<h4>Gardens and Farms</h4>
	<li>Flowers on farmland spread to other farmland</li>
	<li>Oak leaves drop apples</li>
	<li>Grass can grow grass blades that can turn into tall grass</li>
	<li>Tall grass can wither into small grass, which themselves can also disappear</li>
	<li>Grass can die in dry biomes</li>
	<h4>Settlements</h4>
	<li>Lichen can spread where dripstone drips water (requires copper ore)</li>
	<li>Gravel settles down into dirt creating coarse dirt</li>
	<li>Gravel settles into dirt around in large bodies of water and with a larger range</li>
	<li>Dirt can turn into mud in large bodies of water</li>
	<li>Mud deposits dirt onto nearby coarse dirt, in large bodies of water</li>
	<h4>Into the Nether</h4>
	<li>Mushrooms spread faster on nylium</li>
	<li>Weeping Vines spread onto Netherrack, and rarely, Nether Wart blocks</li>
	<li>Twisting Vines spread, rarely, onto Warped Nylium and Warped Wart blocks</li>
	<li>Fire Coral does not die in The Nether</li>
</ul>
