			<span>Bridging the past to the future</span>
			<p>This is a small mod for 1.8.9 that adds a few quality-of-life features that are commonly found in modern clients, in modern vanilla, or can be easily found in newer mods. Currently implemented features:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Remove Crosshair from Third Person Cameras</li>
				<li>Show Own Name</li>
				<li>Static FOV</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Additional features planned to be introduced include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Autosave Indicator</li>
				<li>Configuration Screen</li>
				<li>Fix Nametag Angle in Second Person Camera</li>
				<li>Righthand Effect Display on Inventory Screen</li>
				<li>Subtitles</li>
				<li>Toggle Sprint and Sneak</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I have a computer with Windows XP installed on it, and theoretically I can run Minecraft all the way up to 21w18a, but I've had no luck in getting the world to generate post 1.13. I figured that, since it's already running an old and outdated operating system, an old and outdated version of Minecraft to accompany would be a-ok! I'm not putting it on CurseForge or Modrinth because I don't think there are a lot of people deliberately playing on 1.8.9.</p>
