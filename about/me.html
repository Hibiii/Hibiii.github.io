<h1>About Me</h1>
<span>Some description about me</span>
<p>Oh no, it's this page again where I have to talk about myself but I don't like bragging about achievements, it's more about the person and the work I've done rather than "I'm great because this and that."</p>
<p>I'm not perfect, alright? I'm just some nerd that loves games, code and computers. I've taken a beating from life, and I tried to keep a smiley face fa√ßade up but fuel for it is gone. I'm a uni dropout because I had no support and when I finally had some, COVID happened and all sense of belonging fell apart.</p>
<p>I love modding Minecraft, even if my mods aren't popular. I like Minecraft, and I like coding. With it, I know a decent amount of Java, Sponge Mixins, and I also get to flex my pixel art muscles.</p>
<p>During my time in uni, I was assigned projects in pure, raw C. Like yay, I guess? I used to hold a grudge about C but I've learned to like it, because my teachers weren't teaching best C practices.</p>
<p>A long time ago, when I was a child, I used to play a lot on this train simulator called BVE, and then OpenBVE. I still know to this day how to make 3D models for it and how to make train lines for it.</p>
<p>More recently, I've done a couple of projects in JS and TS. These include ncCounter, a "counter" for Neocities that used the Neocities API to get the amount of views, and Kittencraft, a project I decided to bin because it's weird. The code is private, but sheesh... it actually works.</p>

<p>Also, I'm <b>not</b> joking when I said I don't like talking about myself. In fact, talking about myself has put me in such a rancid and defensive mood that I'll just say I don't cope well with being helped. I understand you're only trying to help but I still see you as a threat.</p>
<p>That doesn't help me get a job but I don't care. I know to actually listen to people and think about what they said.</p>
